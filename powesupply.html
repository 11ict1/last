        <h1>What Is Power Supply?</h1>
     <p><strong>A power supply is a component that supplies power to at least one electric load. Typically, it converts one type of electrical power to another, but it may also convert a a different form of energy â€“ such as solar, mechanical, or chemical - into electrical energy.

        A power supply provides components with electric power. The term usually pertains to devices integrated within the component being powered. For example, computer power supplies convert AC current to DC current and are generally located at the rear of the computer case, along with at least one fan.
        
        A power supply is also known as a power supply unit, power brick or power adapter.</strong></p>
