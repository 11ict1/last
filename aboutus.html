      <h3>The Reason Why We Choose Information Communication Technolgy?</h3>
      <p class="p2"><strong>We chose this strand/course/specilization because we want to explore more deeper about on how to use tools and equipments that will allow us to interact in the digital world wherein we could be able to understand whats behind it and to apply this to the next chapter of the course that will take if we were in college. Choosing this strand/course/specialization have a big advantage for us, because we have a background that is related to this topic which we could apply to it. And we have a lot of expectations like gaining more information and to be more knowledgeable in this kind of field. Taking this strad/course/specialization is risk-taking but we assure you that we will not regret choosing this because we believe in our self and abilities. We will do our very best in order to have a high grade. We will always pray to God, listen to every Teacher who teaches in front me/us and to study mo matter what the situation is, in order to have a better performance in ICT and to be an optimist, Always.</strong></p>
